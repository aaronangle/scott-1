            <p>It's one of those things I suppose I've always known: Gila Valley is in my DNA. My grandfather Cleo
                Crockett was born and raised in Pima my grandmother Mary "Mamie" Layton Crockett grew up in Safford and
                my mother Kleis Crockett Bennett was born here.</p>

            <p>Naturally, when I had the opportunity almost 10 years ago to come here as the Chief Deputy County
                Attorney for Graham County, my only decision was what to pack first. Although I was born in Provo, Utah,
                and had worked in Maricopa and Pinal Counties as a prosecutor for some years, somehow this felt like
                coming home.</p>
