            <p>It's one of those things I suppose I've always known: Gila Valley is in my DNA. My grandfather Cleo
                Crockett was born and raised in Pima my grandmother Mary "Mamie" Layton Crockett grew up in Safford and
                my mother Kleis Crockett Bennett was born here.</p>

            <p>Naturally, when I had the opportunity almost 10 years ago to come here as the Chief Deputy County
                Attorney for Graham County, my only decision was what to pack first. Although I was born in Provo, Utah,
                and had worked in Maricopa and Pinal Counties as a prosecutor for some years, somehow this felt like
                coming home.</p>
            <p>
                By trusting me with your vote, I will work in partnership with the excellent law enforcement agencies of
                graham county to continue to make the Gila Valley a terrific and safe place to live, work and raise a
                family.
